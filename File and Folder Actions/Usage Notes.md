##Usage Notes for File and Folder Actions  


**Clear Contents** is a script that will clear the contents of a folder without removing the folder. Useful for  when you're done collaborating/sharing something with someone, but you still need to keep the folder around. I have this saved as a system service.  
<BR>
**Clipboard to File** takes text from your clipboard and saves it to a text, markdown, html, etc, file.    
<BR>
**Copy Path** will copy a file or folders POSIX path to your clipboard. I use this many, many times daily, and it is one of my favorite tools, given the sheer simplicity of the script.  
<BR>
**JPGtoPNG** converts images, because I have a problem with JPG for no reason.  
<BR>
**List Folder Contents** will provide you with a text file containing the contents of a folder of your choosing.  
<BR>  
**Move Files To Folder** saves you from dragging and dropping single files between folders. I have this saved as a  system service.  
<BR>  
**Open File When Connected** allows you to select a file or application to open, and pings google until you are reconnected to the internet. Saves me from having to remember to print that file, or write that note when I get home from work.  
<BR>  
**Script Launcher** like the **App Launcher** in the [Application Services](https://github.com/unforswearing/applescript/tree/master/Application%20Services) section, this script launches other applescripts. You have to hardcode the path to your applescript folder in order for it to work, but it's a neat little thing.
