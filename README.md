Applescripts.
============
<BR>
###Overview
A collection of various applescripts I have created. I try to keep them general (rather than application specific) so that they could be useful to as many people as possible, though many of them are specific to my personal needs.

###Links/Dependencies  

- [Caffeine App](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/) (or [here](http://macdownload.informer.com/caffeine)) - a menu bar application that prevents your monitor from sleeping. (If you don't want an extra application in your menubar, here is [a different way](http://lifehacker.com/5767991/how-to-force-your-mac-to-stay-awake-indefinitely-via-the-command-line), and if you're on 10.8+ [you can go ahead and use this command](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/Manpages/man8/caffeinate.8.html). Both work via ```do shell script```.)
                                                                                    
- [Location Helper](http://www.mousedown.net/mouseware/LocationHelper.html) - use core location in applescripts.  

- [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) and [Textutil](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/textutil.1.html) - document conversion via the command line.    

- I have also created a few [Gists](https://gist.github.com/unforswearing) for more specific applescript/bash related tasks.  


- Details about my amateur scripting successes can be found on my [Applescript blog](http://www.scriptogr.am/unforswearing). Let me write your documentation.

###"Legal"
All scripts are provided AS IS without warranty, etc, etc. All scripts tested on 10.6 and 10.7, and there is a chance that they will not work with newer versions of OSX. Feel free to use parts/all of these scripts in your fancy project (you are encouraged to drop me a line if you do). Take the plunge.
