Applescripts.
============
<BR>
## Overview
A collection of various applescripts I have created. I try to keep them general (rather than application specific) so that they could be useful to as many people as possible, though many of them are specific to my personal needs.  <br>  

Note: This collection isn't updated much anymore, but I'll add to it as needed.

## Links/Dependencies  

- [Caffeine App](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/) (or [here](http://macdownload.informer.com/caffeine)) - a menu bar application that prevents your monitor from sleeping. (If you don't want an extra application in your menubar, here is [a different way](http://lifehacker.com/5767991/how-to-force-your-mac-to-stay-awake-indefinitely-via-the-command-line), and if you're on 10.8+ [you can go ahead and use this command](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/Manpages/man8/caffeinate.8.html). Both work via ```do shell script```.)
                                                                                    
- [Location Helper](http://www.mousedown.net/mouseware/LocationHelper.html) - use core location in applescripts.   

- [Twitter Scripter](http://www.mousedown.net/mouseware/TwitterScripter.html) - interact with twitter via applescript.  

- [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) and [Textutil](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/textutil.1.html) - document conversion via the command line.    

- `Youtube-Post.scpt` requires [GoogleCL](https://code.google.com/p/googlecl/), which is also useful for blogger, google calendar, and contacts.      

- I have also created a few [Gists](https://gist.github.com/unforswearing) for more specific applescript/bash related tasks, with a growing list of shell scripts also [located here](https://github.com/unforswearing/Shell).  

- Also, check out my [Alfred Workflows](https://github.com/unforswearing/alfredWorkflows), including [dued](https://github.com/unforswearing/dued), which may be my favorite creation.
