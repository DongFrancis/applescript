applescript
===========

A collection of various applescripts I have created. 

My infrequently updated applescript blog -- http://www.scriptogr.am/unforswearing

Some of these scripts use:  

- Location Helper: http://www.mousedown.net/mouseware/LocationHelper.html  
- Caffeine: http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/ 
- (if the above Caffeine link is down, http://macdownload.informer.com/Dev/lighthead-software/ should be OK)


=============
Looking for Pandoc scripts, if they are available.
