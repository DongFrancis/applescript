Applescripts.
============
<BR>
###Overview
A collection of various applescripts I have created. I try to keep them general (rather than application specific) so that they could be useful to as many people as possible, though many of them are specific to my personal needs.

###Script Categories 
Listed as folders above. Most scripts should be self-explanatory, however, short descriptions for each folder will come soon.

###Links/Dependencies  

- [Caffeine App](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/) (or [here](http://macdownload.informer.com/caffeine)) - a menu bar application that prevents your monitor from sleeping. (If you don't want an extra application in your menubar, here is [a different way](http://lifehacker.com/5767991/how-to-force-your-mac-to-stay-awake-indefinitely-via-the-command-line), and if you're on 10.8+ [you can go ahead and use this command](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/Manpages/man8/caffeinate.8.html). Both work via ```do shell script```.)
                                                                                    
- [Location Helper](http://www.mousedown.net/mouseware/LocationHelper.html) - use core location in applescripts.  

- [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) and [Textutil](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/textutil.1.html) - document conversion via the command line.    

- I have also created a few [Gists](https://gist.github.com/unforswearing) for more specific applescript/bash related tasks.  


- Details about my amateur scripting successes can be found on my [Applescript blog](http://www.scriptogr.am/unforswearing). Let me write your documentation.
