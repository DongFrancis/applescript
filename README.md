applescripts.

###overview
A collection of various applescripts I have created. I try to keep them general (rather than application specific) so that they could be useful to as many people as possible. If you run into any problems with these scripts, feel free to let me know! ``notes@theforeverarrow.com`` or via [issue tracker](https://github.com/unforswearing/applescript/issues).

- [Caffeine App](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/) (or [here](http://macdownload.informer.com/caffeine)) - a menu bar application that prevents your monitor from sleeping. (If you don't want an extra application in your menubar, there are [Other Ways](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/Manpages/man8/caffeinate.8.html) to script a [disable sleep](http://lifehacker.com/5767991/how-to-force-your-mac-to-stay-awake-indefinitely-via-the-command-line) command via ```do shell script```.
                                                                                    
- [Location Helper](http://www.mousedown.net/mouseware/LocationHelper.html) - use core location in applescripts.  

- [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) and [Textutil](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/textutil.1.html) - document conversion via the command line.

###legal
All scripts are provided AS IS without warranty, etc, etc. All scripts tested on 10.6 and 10.7, and there is a chance that they will not work with newer versions of OSX. Feel free to use parts/all of these scripts in your fancy project (you are encouraged to drop me a line if you do). Take the plunge.
