- [Caffeine App](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/) (or [here](http://macdownload.informer.com/caffeine)) - a menu bar application that prevents your monitor from sleeping. (If you don't want an extra application in your menubar, there are [Other Ways](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/Manpages/man8/caffeinate.8.html) to script a [disable sleep](http://lifehacker.com/5767991/how-to-force-your-mac-to-stay-awake-indefinitely-via-the-command-line) command via ```do shell script```.

- [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) and [Textutil](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/textutil.1.html) - document conversion via the command line.    

- [I have also created a few Gists](https://gist.github.com/unforswearing) for application-specific scripts.

###legal
All scripts are provided AS IS without warranty, etc, etc. All scripts tested on 10.6 and 10.7, and there is a chance that they will not work with newer versions of OSX. Feel free to use parts/all of these scripts in your fancy project (you are encouraged to drop me a line if you do). Take the plunge.
