###other things
[My infrequently updated applescript blog](http://www.scriptogr.am/unforswearing)

[Location Helper](http://www.mousedown.net/mouseware/LocationHelper.html)  

[Caffeine App](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/) or [here](http://macdownload.informer.com/caffeine)

Also, if you are running a newer version of OSX (10.8 and up), you can replace the Caffeine application with the [caffeinate command](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/Manpages/man8/caffeinate.8.html): 

``$ caffeinate -t 180`` 

where ``180`` is however many seconds you want to disable the screensaver/sleep.
