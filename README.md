###other things
My infrequently updated applescript blog -- http://www.scriptogr.am/unforswearing

Location Helper: http://www.mousedown.net/mouseware/LocationHelper.html  

Caffeine: http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/ (if the lighthead link is down, http://macdownload.informer.com/caffeine/ should be OK)

Also, if you are running a newer version of OSX (I'm on Lion), you can replace the Caffeine application with the caffeinate command -- ```$ caffeinate -t 180`` (where 180 is however many seconds you need the command to run.

###"legal"
All scripts are provided AS IS without warranty, etc, etc.
